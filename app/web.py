"""The web pages: the home page, sign-in through the provider, sign-out, and Settings.

    /               what Spotter is, the MCP address, how to connect it to Claude
    /sign-in        sends the person to the provider (signed in: on to /settings)
    /auth/callback  checks `state`, finishes the sign-in, finds or creates the user
    /sign-out       POST: ends the session
    /settings       the account, and the time zone form (signed out: on to /sign-in)
    PLACEHOLDERS    every other page links.py names, until its real page is built (behind sign-in)

The session is Spotter's own signed cookie. After sign-in it holds exactly the user id, the CSRF token,
the provider's session id (for signing out there too) and the sign-in time. No provider token ever
goes into it. A session older than SESSION_DAYS from its sign-in is signed out, however recently the
cookie was renewed. Every non-GET route checks the CSRF token first.

Web sign-in fails closed: without the provider values, a session key or the site address, every page
but / says sign-in is not set up, no session is kept, and MCP is unaffected.

Database calls are synchronous, so they run in a worker thread, never on the event loop.
